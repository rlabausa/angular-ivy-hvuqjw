# Coding Challenge

## Part 1

Fix two issues preventing our application from rendering:

- Runtime error
- Chat messages are not displaying

## Part 2

Modify the code so that the following are true:

- `user3` 's screen name appears in the chat messages as **red** text.
- The value `user3` should be dynamic
  - _Any_ component can set or pass in a single username when embedding the `MessageComponent` in its own HTML template and that will display the username in **red** text.
